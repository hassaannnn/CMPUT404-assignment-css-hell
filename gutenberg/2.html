<h1>THE BEAST IN THE JUNGLE</h1>
<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<p>What determined the speech that startled him in the course of their
encounter scarcely matters, being probably but some words spoken by
himself quite without intention&mdash;spoken as they lingered and slowly
moved together after their renewal of acquaintance.&nbsp; He had been
conveyed by friends an hour or two before to the house at which she
was staying; the party of visitors at the other house, of whom he was
one, and thanks to whom it was his theory, as always, that he was lost
in the crowd, had been invited over to luncheon.&nbsp; There had been
after luncheon much dispersal, all in the interest of the original motive,
a view of Weatherend itself and the fine things, intrinsic features,
pictures, heirlooms, treasures of all the arts, that made the place
almost famous; and the great rooms were so numerous that guests could
wander at their will, hang back from the principal group and in cases
where they took such matters with the last seriousness give themselves
up to mysterious appreciations and measurements.&nbsp; There were persons
to be observed, singly or in couples, bending toward objects in out-of-the-way
corners with their hands on their knees and their heads nodding quite
as with the emphasis of an excited sense of smell.&nbsp; When they were
two they either mingled their sounds of ecstasy or melted into silences
of even deeper import, so that there were aspects of the occasion that
gave it for Marcher much the air of the &ldquo;look round,&rdquo; previous
to a sale highly advertised, that excites or quenches, as may be, the
dream of acquisition.&nbsp; The dream of acquisition at Weatherend would
have had to be wild indeed, and John Marcher found himself, among such
suggestions, disconcerted almost equally by the presence of those who
knew too much and by that of those who knew nothing.&nbsp; The great
rooms caused so much poetry and history to press upon him that he needed
some straying apart to feel in a proper relation with them, though this
impulse was not, as happened, like the gloating of some of his companions,
to be compared to the movements of a dog sniffing a cupboard.&nbsp;
It had an issue promptly enough in a direction that was not to have
been calculated.</p>
<p>It led, briefly, in the course of the October afternoon, to his closer
meeting with May Bartram, whose face, a reminder, yet not quite a remembrance,
as they sat much separated at a very long table, had begun merely by
troubling him rather pleasantly.&nbsp; It affected him as the sequel
of something of which he had lost the beginning.&nbsp; He knew it, and
for the time quite welcomed it, as a continuation, but didn&rsquo;t
know what it continued, which was an interest or an amusement the greater
as he was also somehow aware&mdash;yet without a direct sign from her&mdash;that
the young woman herself hadn&rsquo;t lost the thread.&nbsp; She hadn&rsquo;t
lost it, but she wouldn&rsquo;t give it back to him, he saw, without
some putting forth of his hand for it; and he not only saw that, but
saw several things more, things odd enough in the light of the fact
that at the moment some accident of grouping brought them face to face
he was still merely fumbling with the idea that any contact between
them in the past would have had no importance.&nbsp; If it had had no
importance he scarcely knew why his actual impression of her should
so seem to have so much; the answer to which, however, was that in such
a life as they all appeared to be leading for the moment one could but
take things as they came.&nbsp; He was satisfied, without in the least
being able to say why, that this young lady might roughly have ranked
in the house as a poor relation; satisfied also that she was not there
on a brief visit, but was more or less a part of the establishment&mdash;almost
a working, a remunerated part.&nbsp; Didn&rsquo;t she enjoy at periods
a protection that she paid for by helping, among other services, to
show the place and explain it, deal with the tiresome people, answer
questions about the dates of the building, the styles of the furniture,
the authorship of the pictures, the favourite haunts of the ghost?&nbsp;
It wasn&rsquo;t that she looked as if you could have given her shillings&mdash;it
was impossible to look less so.&nbsp; Yet when she finally drifted toward
him, distinctly handsome, though ever so much older&mdash;older than
when he had seen her before&mdash;it might have been as an effect of
her guessing that he had, within the couple of hours, devoted more imagination
to her than to all the others put together, and had thereby penetrated
to a kind of truth that the others were too stupid for.&nbsp; She <i>was</i>
there on harder terms than any one; she was there as a consequence of
things suffered, one way and another, in the interval of years; and
she remembered him very much as she was remembered&mdash;only a good
deal better.</p>
<p>By the time they at last thus came to speech they were alone in one
of the rooms&mdash;remarkable for a fine portrait over the chimney-place&mdash;out
of which their friends had passed, and the charm of it was that even
before they had spoken they had practically arranged with each other
to stay behind for talk.&nbsp; The charm, happily, was in other things
too&mdash;partly in there being scarce a spot at Weatherend without
something to stay behind for.&nbsp; It was in the way the autumn day
looked into the high windows as it waned; the way the red light, breaking
at the close from under a low sombre sky, reached out in a long shaft
and played over old wainscots, old tapestry, old gold, old colour.&nbsp;
It was most of all perhaps in the way she came to him as if, since she
had been turned on to deal with the simpler sort, he might, should he
choose to keep the whole thing down, just take her mild attention for
a part of her general business.&nbsp; As soon as he heard her voice,
however, the gap was filled up and the missing link supplied; the slight
irony he divined in her attitude lost its advantage.&nbsp; He almost
jumped at it to get there before her.&nbsp; &ldquo;I met you years and
years ago in Rome.&nbsp; I remember all about it.&rdquo;&nbsp; She confessed
to disappointment&mdash;she had been so sure he didn&rsquo;t; and to
prove how well he did he began to pour forth the particular recollections
that popped up as he called for them.&nbsp; Her face and her voice,
all at his service now, worked the miracle&mdash;the impression operating
like the torch of a lamplighter who touches into flame, one by one,
a long row of gas-jets.&nbsp; Marcher flattered himself the illumination
was brilliant, yet he was really still more pleased on her showing him,
with amusement, that in his haste to make everything right he had got
most things rather wrong.&nbsp; It hadn&rsquo;t been at Rome&mdash;it
had been at Naples; and it hadn&rsquo;t been eight years before&mdash;it
had been more nearly ten.&nbsp; She hadn&rsquo;t been, either, with
her uncle and aunt, but with her mother and brother; in addition to
which it was not with the Pembles <i>he</i> had been, but with the Boyers,
coming down in their company from Rome&mdash;a point on which she insisted,
a little to his confusion, and as to which she had her evidence in hand.&nbsp;
The Boyers she had known, but didn&rsquo;t know the Pembles, though
she had heard of them, and it was the people he was with who had made
them acquainted.&nbsp; The incident of the thunderstorm that had raged
round them with such violence as to drive them for refuge into an excavation&mdash;this
incident had not occurred at the Palace of the Caesars, but at Pompeii,
on an occasion when they had been present there at an important find.</p>
<p>He accepted her amendments, he enjoyed her corrections, though the
moral of them was, she pointed out, that he <i>really</i> didn&rsquo;t
remember the least thing about her; and he only felt it as a drawback
that when all was made strictly historic there didn&rsquo;t appear much
of anything left.&nbsp; They lingered together still, she neglecting
her office&mdash;for from the moment he was so clever she had no proper
right to him&mdash;and both neglecting the house, just waiting as to
see if a memory or two more wouldn&rsquo;t again breathe on them.&nbsp;
It hadn&rsquo;t taken them many minutes, after all, to put down on the
table, like the cards of a pack, those that constituted their respective
hands; only what came out was that the pack was unfortunately not perfect&mdash;that
the past, invoked, invited, encouraged, could give them, naturally,
no more than it had.&nbsp; It had made them anciently meet&mdash;her
at twenty, him at twenty-five; but nothing was so strange, they seemed
to say to each other, as that, while so occupied, it hadn&rsquo;t done
a little more for them.&nbsp; They looked at each other as with the
feeling of an occasion missed; the present would have been so much better
if the other, in the far distance, in the foreign land, hadn&rsquo;t
been so stupidly meagre.&nbsp; There weren&rsquo;t, apparently, all
counted, more than a dozen little old things that had succeeded in coming
to pass between them; trivialities of youth, simplicities of freshness,
stupidities of ignorance, small possible germs, but too deeply buried&mdash;too
deeply (didn&rsquo;t it seem?) to sprout after so many years.&nbsp;
Marcher could only feel he ought to have rendered her some service&mdash;saved
her from a capsized boat in the bay or at least recovered her dressing-bag,
filched from her cab in the streets of Naples by a lazzarone with a
stiletto.&nbsp; Or it would have been nice if he could have been taken
with fever all alone at his hotel, and she could have come to look after
him, to write to his people, to drive him out in convalescence.&nbsp;
<i>Then</i> they would be in possession of the something or other that
their actual show seemed to lack.&nbsp; It yet somehow presented itself,
this show, as too good to be spoiled; so that they were reduced for
a few minutes more to wondering a little helplessly why&mdash;since
they seemed to know a certain number of the same people&mdash;their
reunion had been so long averted.&nbsp; They didn&rsquo;t use that name
for it, but their delay from minute to minute to join the others was
a kind of confession that they didn&rsquo;t quite want it to be a failure.&nbsp;
Their attempted supposition of reasons for their not having met but
showed how little they knew of each other.&nbsp; There came in fact
a moment when Marcher felt a positive pang.&nbsp; It was vain to pretend
she was an old friend, for all the communities were wanting, in spite
of which it was as an old friend that he saw she would have suited him.&nbsp;
He had new ones enough&mdash;was surrounded with them for instance on
the stage of the other house; as a new one he probably wouldn&rsquo;t
have so much as noticed her.&nbsp; He would have liked to invent something,
get her to make-believe with him that some passage of a romantic or
critical kind <i>had</i> originally occurred.&nbsp; He was really almost
reaching out in imagination&mdash;as against time&mdash;for something
that would do, and saying to himself that if it didn&rsquo;t come this
sketch of a fresh start would show for quite awkwardly bungled.&nbsp;
They would separate, and now for no second or no third chance.&nbsp;
They would have tried and not succeeded.&nbsp; Then it was, just at
the turn, as he afterwards made it out to himself, that, everything
else failing, she herself decided to take up the case and, as it were,
save the situation.&nbsp; He felt as soon as she spoke that she had
been consciously keeping back what she said and hoping to get on without
it; a scruple in her that immensely touched him when, by the end of
three or four minutes more, he was able to measure it.&nbsp; What she
brought out, at any rate, quite cleared the air and supplied the link&mdash;the
link it was so odd he should frivolously have managed to lose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know you told me something I&rsquo;ve never forgotten
and that again and again has made me think of you since; it was that
tremendously hot day when we went to Sorrento, across the bay, for the
breeze.&nbsp; What I allude to was what you said to me, on the way back,
as we sat under the awning of the boat enjoying the cool.&nbsp; Have
you forgotten?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had forgotten, and was even more surprised than ashamed.&nbsp;
But the great thing was that he saw in this no vulgar reminder of any
&ldquo;sweet&rdquo; speech.&nbsp; The vanity of women had long memories,
but she was making no claim on him of a compliment or a mistake.&nbsp;
With another woman, a totally different one, he might have feared the
recall possibly even some imbecile &ldquo;offer.&rdquo;&nbsp; So, in
having to say that he had indeed forgotten, he was conscious rather
of a loss than of a gain; he already saw an interest in the matter of
her mention.&nbsp; &ldquo;I try to think&mdash;but I give it up.&nbsp;
Yet I remember the Sorrento day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not very sure you do,&rdquo; May Bartram after a
moment said; &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m not very sure I ought to want you
to.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s dreadful to bring a person back at any time to
what he was ten years before.&nbsp; If you&rsquo;ve lived away from
it,&rdquo; she smiled, &ldquo;so much the better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah if <i>you</i> haven&rsquo;t why should I?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lived away, you mean, from what I myself was?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From what <i>I</i> was.&nbsp; I was of course an ass,&rdquo;
Marcher went on; &ldquo;but I would rather know from you just the sort
of ass I was than&mdash;from the moment you have something in your mind&mdash;not
know anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still, however, she hesitated.&nbsp; &ldquo;But if you&rsquo;ve completely
ceased to be that sort&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why I can then all the more bear to know.&nbsp; Besides, perhaps
I haven&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps.&nbsp; Yet if you haven&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she added,
&ldquo;I should suppose you&rsquo;d remember.&nbsp; Not indeed that
<i>I</i> in the least connect with my impression the invidious name
you use.&nbsp; If I had only thought you foolish,&rdquo; she explained,
&ldquo;the thing I speak of wouldn&rsquo;t so have remained with me.&nbsp;
It was about yourself.&rdquo;&nbsp; She waited as if it might come to
him; but as, only meeting her eyes in wonder, he gave no sign, she burnt
her ships.&nbsp; &ldquo;Has it ever happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then it was that, while he continued to stare, a light broke for
him and the blood slowly came to his face, which began to burn with
recognition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean I told you&mdash;?&rdquo;&nbsp; But he faltered,
lest what came to him shouldn&rsquo;t be right, lest he should only
give himself away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was something about yourself that it was natural one shouldn&rsquo;t
forget&mdash;that is if one remembered you at all.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s
why I ask you,&rdquo; she smiled, &ldquo;if the thing you then spoke
of has ever come to pass?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oh then he saw, but he was lost in wonder and found himself embarrassed.&nbsp;
This, he also saw, made her sorry for him, as if her allusion had been
a mistake.&nbsp; It took him but a moment, however, to feel it hadn&rsquo;t
been, much as it had been a surprise.&nbsp; After the first little shock
of it her knowledge on the contrary began, even if rather strangely,
to taste sweet to him.&nbsp; She was the only other person in the world
then who would have it, and she had had it all these years, while the
fact of his having so breathed his secret had unaccountably faded from
him.&nbsp; No wonder they couldn&rsquo;t have met as if nothing had
happened.&nbsp; &ldquo;I judge,&rdquo; he finally said, &ldquo;that
I know what you mean.&nbsp; Only I had strangely enough lost any sense
of having taken you so far into my confidence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it because you&rsquo;ve taken so many others as well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve taken nobody.&nbsp; Not a creature since then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that I&rsquo;m the only person who knows?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The only person in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she quickly replied, &ldquo;I myself have never
spoken.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve never, never repeated of you what you told
me.&rdquo;&nbsp; She looked at him so that he perfectly believed her.&nbsp;
Their eyes met over it in such a way that he was without a doubt.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And I never will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She spoke with an earnestness that, as if almost excessive, put him
at ease about her possible derision.&nbsp; Somehow the whole question
was a new luxury to him&mdash;that is from the moment she was in possession.&nbsp;
If she didn&rsquo;t take the sarcastic view she clearly took the sympathetic,
and that was what he had had, in all the long time, from no one whomsoever.&nbsp;
What he felt was that he couldn&rsquo;t at present have begun to tell
her, and yet could profit perhaps exquisitely by the accident of having
done so of old.&nbsp; &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t then.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re
just right as it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh I am,&rdquo; she laughed, &ldquo;if you are!&rdquo;&nbsp;
To which she added: &ldquo;Then you do still feel in the same way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was impossible he shouldn&rsquo;t take to himself that she was
really interested, though it all kept coming as a perfect surprise.&nbsp;
He had thought of himself so long as abominably alone, and lo he wasn&rsquo;t
alone a bit.&nbsp; He hadn&rsquo;t been, it appeared, for an hour&mdash;since
those moments on the Sorrento boat.&nbsp; It was she who had been, he
seemed to see as he looked at her&mdash;she who had been made so by
the graceless fact of his lapse of fidelity.&nbsp; To tell her what
he had told her&mdash;what had it been but to ask something of her?
something that she had given, in her charity, without his having, by
a remembrance, by a return of the spirit, failing another encounter,
so much as thanked her.&nbsp; What he had asked of her had been simply
at first not to laugh at him.&nbsp; She had beautifully not done so
for ten years, and she was not doing so now.&nbsp; So he had endless
gratitude to make up.&nbsp; Only for that he must see just how he had
figured to her.&nbsp; &ldquo;What, exactly, was the account I gave&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of the way you did feel?&nbsp; Well, it was very simple.&nbsp;
You said you had had from your earliest time, as the deepest thing within
you, the sense of being kept for something rare and strange, possibly
prodigious and terrible, that was sooner or later to happen to you,
that you had in your bones the foreboding and the conviction of, and
that would perhaps overwhelm you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you call that very simple?&rdquo; John Marcher asked.</p>
<p>She thought a moment.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was perhaps because I seemed,
as you spoke, to understand it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do understand it?&rdquo; he eagerly asked.</p>
<p>Again she kept her kind eyes on him.&nbsp; &ldquo;You still have
the belief?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; he exclaimed helplessly.&nbsp; There was too much
to say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever it&rsquo;s to be,&rdquo; she clearly made out, &ldquo;it
hasn&rsquo;t yet come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shook his head in complete surrender now.&nbsp; &ldquo;It hasn&rsquo;t
yet come.&nbsp; Only, you know, it isn&rsquo;t anything I&rsquo;m to
do, to achieve in the world, to be distinguished or admired for.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m not such an ass as <i>that</i>.&nbsp; It would be much better,
no doubt, if I were.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s to be something you&rsquo;re merely to suffer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, say to wait for&mdash;to have to meet, to face, to see
suddenly break out in my life; possibly destroying all further consciousness,
possibly annihilating me; possibly, on the other hand, only altering
everything, striking at the root of all my world and leaving me to the
consequences, however they shape themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She took this in, but the light in her eyes continued for him not
to be that of mockery.&nbsp; &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t what you describe perhaps
but the expectation&mdash;or at any rate the sense of danger, familiar
to so many people&mdash;of falling in love?&rdquo;</p>
<p>John Marcher thought.&nbsp; &ldquo;Did you ask me that before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;I wasn&rsquo;t so free-and-easy then.&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s
what strikes me now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he said after a moment, &ldquo;it strikes
you.&nbsp; Of course it strikes <i>me</i>.&nbsp; Of course what&rsquo;s
in store for me may be no more than that.&nbsp; The only thing is,&rdquo;
he went on, &ldquo;that I think if it had been that I should by this
time know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean because you&rsquo;ve <i>been</i> in love?&rdquo;&nbsp;
And then as he but looked at her in silence: &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been
in love, and it hasn&rsquo;t meant such a cataclysm, hasn&rsquo;t proved
the great affair?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here I am, you see.&nbsp; It hasn&rsquo;t been overwhelming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it hasn&rsquo;t been love,&rdquo; said May Bartram.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I at least thought it was.&nbsp; I took it for that&mdash;I&rsquo;ve
taken it till now.&nbsp; It was agreeable, it was delightful, it was
miserable,&rdquo; he explained.&nbsp; &ldquo;But it wasn&rsquo;t strange.&nbsp;
It wasn&rsquo;t what my affair&rsquo;s to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want something all to yourself&mdash;something that nobody
else knows or <i>has</i> known?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t a question of what I &lsquo;want&rsquo;&mdash;God
knows I don&rsquo;t want anything.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s only a question
of the apprehension that haunts me&mdash;that I live with day by day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said this so lucidly and consistently that he could see it further
impose itself.&nbsp; If she hadn&rsquo;t been interested before she&rsquo;d
have been interested now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it a sense of coming violence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Evidently now too again he liked to talk of it.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
think of it as&mdash;when it does come&mdash;necessarily violent.&nbsp;
I only think of it as natural and as of course above all unmistakeable.&nbsp;
I think of it simply as <i>the</i> thing.&nbsp; <i>The</i> thing will
of itself appear natural.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then how will it appear strange?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marcher bethought himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t&mdash;to <i>me</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To whom then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he replied, smiling at last, &ldquo;say to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh then I&rsquo;m to be present?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why you are present&mdash;since you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see.&rdquo;&nbsp; She turned it over.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I
mean at the catastrophe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this, for a minute, their lightness gave way to their gravity;
it was as if the long look they exchanged held them together.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It will only depend on yourself&mdash;if you&rsquo;ll watch with
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you afraid?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t leave me now,&rdquo; he went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you afraid?&rdquo; she repeated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think me simply out of my mind?&rdquo; he pursued instead
of answering.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do I merely strike you as a harmless lunatic?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said May Bartram.&nbsp; &ldquo;I understand you.&nbsp;
I believe you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean you feel how my obsession&mdash;poor old thing&mdash;may
correspond to some possible reality?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To some possible reality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you <i>will</i> watch with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She hesitated, then for the third time put her question.&nbsp; &ldquo;Are
you afraid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did I tell you I was&mdash;at Naples?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you said nothing about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; And I should like to know,&rdquo;
said John Marcher.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll tell me yourself whether
you think so.&nbsp; If you&rsquo;ll watch with me you&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good then.&rdquo;&nbsp; They had been moving by this
time across the room, and at the door, before passing out, they paused
as for the full wind-up of their understanding.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
watch with you,&rdquo; said May Bartram.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<p>The fact that she &ldquo;knew&rdquo;&mdash;knew and yet neither chaffed
him nor betrayed him&mdash;had in a short time begun to constitute between
them a goodly bond, which became more marked when, within the year that
followed their afternoon at Weatherend, the opportunities for meeting
multiplied.&nbsp; The event that thus promoted these occasions was the
death of the ancient lady her great-aunt, under whose wing, since losing
her mother, she had to such an extent found shelter, and who, though
but the widowed mother of the new successor to the property, had succeeded&mdash;thanks
to a high tone and a high temper&mdash;in not forfeiting the supreme
position at the great house.&nbsp; The deposition of this personage
arrived but with her death, which, followed by many changes, made in
particular a difference for the young woman in whom Marcher&rsquo;s
expert attention had recognised from the first a dependent with a pride
that might ache though it didn&rsquo;t bristle.&nbsp; Nothing for a
long time had made him easier than the thought that the aching must
have been much soothed by Miss Bartram&rsquo;s now finding herself able
to set up a small home in London.&nbsp; She had acquired property, to
an amount that made that luxury just possible, under her aunt&rsquo;s
extremely complicated will, and when the whole matter began to be straightened
out, which indeed took time, she let him know that the happy issue was
at last in view.&nbsp; He had seen her again before that day, both because
she had more than once accompanied the ancient lady to town and because
he had paid another visit to the friends who so conveniently made of
Weatherend one of the charms of their own hospitality.&nbsp; These friends
had taken him back there; he had achieved there again with Miss Bartram
some quiet detachment; and he had in London succeeded in persuading
her to more than one brief absence from her aunt.&nbsp; They went together,
on these latter occasions, to the National Gallery and the South Kensington
Museum, where, among vivid reminders, they talked of Italy at large&mdash;not
now attempting to recover, as at first, the taste of their youth and
their ignorance.&nbsp; That recovery, the first day at Weatherend, had
served its purpose well, had given them quite enough; so that they were,
to Marcher&rsquo;s sense, no longer hovering about the head-waters of
their stream, but had felt their boat pushed sharply off and down the
current.</p>
<p>They were literally afloat together; for our gentleman this was marked,
quite as marked as that the fortunate cause of it was just the buried
treasure of her knowledge.&nbsp; He had with his own hands dug up this
little hoard, brought to light&mdash;that is to within reach of the
dim day constituted by their discretions and privacies&mdash;the object
of value the hiding-place of which he had, after putting it into the
ground himself, so strangely, so long forgotten.&nbsp; The rare luck
of his having again just stumbled on the spot made him indifferent to
any other question; he would doubtless have devoted more time to the
odd accident of his lapse of memory if he hadn&rsquo;t been moved to
devote so much to the sweetness, the comfort, as he felt, for the future,
that this accident itself had helped to keep fresh.&nbsp; It had never
entered into his plan that any one should &ldquo;know&rdquo;, and mainly
for the reason that it wasn&rsquo;t in him to tell any one.&nbsp; That
would have been impossible, for nothing but the amusement of a cold
world would have waited on it.&nbsp; Since, however, a mysterious fate
had opened his mouth betimes, in spite of him, he would count that a
compensation and profit by it to the utmost.&nbsp; That the right person
<i>should</i> know tempered the asperity of his secret more even than
his shyness had permitted him to imagine; and May Bartram was clearly
right, because&mdash;well, because there she was.&nbsp; Her knowledge
simply settled it; he would have been sure enough by this time had she
been wrong.&nbsp; There was that in his situation, no doubt, that disposed
him too much to see her as a mere confidant, taking all her light for
him from the fact&mdash;the fact only&mdash;of her interest in his predicament;
from her mercy, sympathy, seriousness, her consent not to regard him
as the funniest of the funny.&nbsp; Aware, in fine, that her price for
him was just in her giving him this constant sense of his being admirably
spared, he was careful to remember that she had also a life of her own,
with things that might happen to <i>her</i>, things that in friendship
one should likewise take account of.&nbsp; Something fairly remarkable
came to pass with him, for that matter, in this connexion&mdash;something
represented by a certain passage of his consciousness, in the suddenest
way, from one extreme to the other.</p>
<p>He had thought himself, so long as nobody knew, the most disinterested
person in the world, carrying his concentrated burden, his perpetual
suspense, ever so quietly, holding his tongue about it, giving others
no glimpse of it nor of its effect upon his life, asking of them no
allowance and only making on his side all those that were asked.&nbsp;
He hadn&rsquo;t disturbed people with the queerness of their having
to know a haunted man, though he had had moments of rather special temptation
on hearing them say they were forsooth &ldquo;unsettled.&rdquo;&nbsp;
If they were as unsettled as he was&mdash;he who had never been settled
for an hour in his life&mdash;they would know what it meant.&nbsp; Yet
it wasn&rsquo;t, all the same, for him to make them, and he listened
to them civilly enough.&nbsp; This was why he had such good&mdash;though
possibly such rather colourless&mdash;manners; this was why, above all,
he could regard himself, in a greedy world, as decently&mdash;as in
fact perhaps even a little sublimely&mdash;unselfish.&nbsp; Our point
is accordingly that he valued this character quite sufficiently to measure
his present danger of letting it lapse, against which he promised himself
to be much on his guard.&nbsp; He was quite ready, none the less, to
be selfish just a little, since surely no more charming occasion for
it had come to him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Just a little,&rdquo; in a word, was
just as much as Miss Bartram, taking one day with another, would let
him.&nbsp; He never would be in the least coercive, and would keep well
before him the lines on which consideration for her&mdash;the very highest&mdash;ought
to proceed.&nbsp; He would thoroughly establish the heads under which
her affairs, her requirements, her peculiarities&mdash;he went so far
as to give them the latitude of that name&mdash;would come into their
intercourse.&nbsp; All this naturally was a sign of how much he took
the intercourse itself for granted.&nbsp; There was nothing more to
be done about that.&nbsp; It simply existed; had sprung into being with
her first penetrating question to him in the autumn light there at Weatherend.&nbsp;
The real form it should have taken on the basis that stood out large
was the form of their marrying.&nbsp; But the devil in this was that
the very basis itself put marrying out of the question.&nbsp; His conviction,
his apprehension, his obsession, in short, wasn&rsquo;t a privilege
he could invite a woman to share; and that consequence of it was precisely
what was the matter with him.&nbsp; Something or other lay in wait for
him, amid the twists and the turns of the months and the years, like
a crouching Beast in the Jungle.&nbsp; It signified little whether the
crouching Beast were destined to slay him or to be slain.&nbsp; The
definite point was the inevitable spring of the creature; and the definite
lesson from that was that a man of feeling didn&rsquo;t cause himself
to be accompanied by a lady on a tiger-hunt.&nbsp; Such was the image
under which he had ended by figuring his life.</p>
<p>They had at first, none the less, in the scattered hours spent together,
made no allusion to that view of it; which was a sign he was handsomely
alert to give that he didn&rsquo;t expect, that he in fact didn&rsquo;t
care, always to be talking about it.&nbsp; Such a feature in one&rsquo;s
outlook was really like a hump on one&rsquo;s back.&nbsp; The difference
it made every minute of the day existed quite independently of discussion.&nbsp;
One discussed of course <i>like</i> a hunchback, for there was always,
if nothing else, the hunchback face.&nbsp; That remained, and she was
watching him; but people watched best, as a general thing, in silence,
so that such would be predominantly the manner of their vigil.&nbsp;
Yet he didn&rsquo;t want, at the same time, to be tense and solemn;
tense and solemn was what he imagined he too much showed for with other
people.&nbsp; The thing to be, with the one person who knew, was easy
and natural&mdash;to make the reference rather than be seeming to avoid
it, to avoid it rather than be seeming to make it, and to keep it, in
any case, familiar, facetious even, rather than pedantic and portentous.&nbsp;
Some such consideration as the latter was doubtless in his mind for
instance when he wrote pleasantly to Miss Bartram that perhaps the great
thing he had so long felt as in the lap of the gods was no more than
this circumstance, which touched him so nearly, of her acquiring a house
in London.&nbsp; It was the first allusion they had yet again made,
needing any other hitherto so little; but when she replied, after having
given him the news, that she was by no means satisfied with such a trifle
as the climax to so special a suspense, she almost set him wondering
if she hadn&rsquo;t even a larger conception of singularity for him
than he had for himself.&nbsp; He was at all events destined to become
aware little by little, as time went by, that she was all the while
looking at his life, judging it, measuring it, in the light of the thing
she knew, which grew to be at last, with the consecration of the years,
never mentioned between them save as &ldquo;the real truth&rdquo; about
him.&nbsp; That had always been his own form of reference to it, but
she adopted the form so quietly that, looking back at the end of a period,
he knew there was no moment at which it was traceable that she had,
as he might say, got inside his idea, or exchanged the attitude of beautifully
indulging for that of still more beautifully believing him.</p>
<p>It was always open to him to accuse her of seeing him but as the
most harmless of maniacs, and this, in the long run&mdash;since it covered
so much ground&mdash;was his easiest description of their friendship.&nbsp;
He had a screw loose for her but she liked him in spite of it and was
practically, against the rest of the world, his kind wise keeper, unremunerated
but fairly amused and, in the absence of other near ties, not disreputably
occupied.&nbsp; The rest of the world of course thought him queer, but
she, she only, knew how, and above all why, queer; which was precisely
what enabled her to dispose the concealing veil in the right folds.&nbsp;
She took his gaiety from him&mdash;since it had to pass with them for
gaiety&mdash;as she took everything else; but she certainly so far justified
by her unerring touch his finer sense of the degree to which he had
ended by convincing her.&nbsp; <i>She</i> at least never spoke of the
secret of his life except as &ldquo;the real truth about you,&rdquo;
and she had in fact a wonderful way of making it seem, as such, the
secret of her own life too.&nbsp; That was in fine how he so constantly
felt her as allowing for him; he couldn&rsquo;t on the whole call it
anything else.&nbsp; He allowed for himself, but she, exactly, allowed
still more; partly because, better placed for a sight of the matter,
she traced his unhappy perversion through reaches of its course into
which he could scarce follow it.&nbsp; He knew how he felt, but, besides
knowing that, she knew how he looked as well; he knew each of the things
of importance he was insidiously kept from doing, but she could add
up the amount they made, understand how much, with a lighter weight
on his spirit, he might have done, and thereby establish how, clever
as he was, he fell short.&nbsp; Above all she was in the secret of the
difference between the forms he went through&mdash;those of his little
office under Government, those of caring for his modest patrimony, for
his library, for his garden in the country, for the people in London
whose invitations he accepted and repaid&mdash;and the detachment that
reigned beneath them and that made of all behaviour, all that could
in the least be called behaviour, a long act of dissimulation.&nbsp;
What it had come to was that he wore a mask painted with the social
simper, out of the eye-holes of which there looked eyes of an expression
not in the least matching the other features.&nbsp; This the stupid
world, even after years, had never more than half discovered.&nbsp;
It was only May Bartram who had, and she achieved, by an art indescribable,
the feat of at once&mdash;or perhaps it was only alternately&mdash;meeting
the eyes from in front and mingling her own vision, as from over his
shoulder, with their peep through the apertures.</p>
<p>So while they grew older together she did watch with him, and so
she let this association give shape and colour to her own existence.&nbsp;
Beneath <i>her</i> forms as well detachment had learned to sit, and
behaviour had become for her, in the social sense, a false account of
herself.&nbsp; There was but one account of her that would have been
true all the while and that she could give straight to nobody, least
of all to John Marcher.&nbsp; Her whole attitude was a virtual statement,
but the perception of that only seemed called to take its place for
him as one of the many things necessarily crowded out of his consciousness.&nbsp;
If she had moreover, like himself, to make sacrifices to their real
truth, it was to be granted that her compensation might have affected
her as more prompt and more natural.&nbsp; They had long periods, in
this London time, during which, when they were together, a stranger
might have listened to them without in the least pricking up his ears;
on the other hand the real truth was equally liable at any moment to
rise to the surface, and the auditor would then have wondered indeed
what they were talking about.&nbsp; They had from an early hour made
up their mind that society was, luckily, unintelligent, and the margin
allowed them by this had fairly become one of their commonplaces.&nbsp;
Yet there were still moments when the situation turned almost fresh&mdash;usually
under the effect of some expression drawn from herself.&nbsp; Her expressions
doubtless repeated themselves, but her intervals were generous.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What saves us, you know, is that we answer so completely to so
usual an appearance: that of the man and woman whose friendship has
become such a daily habit&mdash;or almost&mdash;as to be at last indispensable.&rdquo;&nbsp;
That for instance was a remark she had frequently enough had occasion
to make, though she had given it at different times different developments.&nbsp;
What we are especially concerned with is the turn it happened to take
from her one afternoon when he had come to see her in honour of her
birthday.&nbsp; This anniversary had fallen on a Sunday, at a season
of thick fog and general outward gloom; but he had brought her his customary
offering, having known her now long enough to have established a hundred
small traditions.&nbsp; It was one of his proofs to himself, the present
he made her on her birthday, that he hadn&rsquo;t sunk into real selfishness.&nbsp;
It was mostly nothing more than a small trinket, but it was always fine
of its kind, and he was regularly careful to pay for it more than he
thought he could afford.&nbsp; &ldquo;Our habit saves you, at least,
don&rsquo;t you see? because it makes you, after all, for the vulgar,
indistinguishable from other men.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s the most inveterate
mark of men in general?&nbsp; Why the capacity to spend endless time
with dull women&mdash;to spend it I won&rsquo;t say without being bored,
but without minding that they are, without being driven off at a tangent
by it; which comes to the same thing.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m your dull woman,
a part of the daily bread for which you pray at church.&nbsp; That covers
your tracks more than anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what covers yours?&rdquo; asked Marcher, whom his dull
woman could mostly to this extent amuse.&nbsp; &ldquo;I see of course
what you mean by your saving me, in this way and that, so far as other
people are concerned&mdash;I&rsquo;ve seen it all along.&nbsp; Only
what is it that saves <i>you</i>?&nbsp; I often think, you know, of
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked as if she sometimes thought of that too, but rather in
a different way.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where other people, you mean, are concerned?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re really so in with me, you know&mdash;as
a sort of result of my being so in with yourself.&nbsp; I mean of my
having such an immense regard for you, being so tremendously mindful
of all you&rsquo;ve done for me.&nbsp; I sometimes ask myself if it&rsquo;s
quite fair.&nbsp; Fair I mean to have so involved and&mdash;since one
may say it&mdash;interested you.&nbsp; I almost feel as if you hadn&rsquo;t
really had time to do anything else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything else but be interested?&rdquo; she asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah
what else does one ever want to be?&nbsp; If I&rsquo;ve been &lsquo;watching&rsquo;
with you, as we long ago agreed I was to do, watching&rsquo;s always
in itself an absorption.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh certainly,&rdquo; John Marcher said, &ldquo;if you hadn&rsquo;t
had your curiosity&mdash;!&nbsp; Only doesn&rsquo;t it sometimes come
to you as time goes on that your curiosity isn&rsquo;t being particularly
repaid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>May Bartram had a pause.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you ask that, by any chance,
because you feel at all that yours isn&rsquo;t?&nbsp; I mean because
you have to wait so long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oh he understood what she meant!&nbsp; &ldquo;For the thing to happen
that never does happen?&nbsp; For the Beast to jump out?&nbsp; No, I&rsquo;m
just where I was about it.&nbsp; It isn&rsquo;t a matter as to which
I can <i>choose</i>, I can decide for a change.&nbsp; It isn&rsquo;t
one as to which there <i>can</i> be a change.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s in the
lap of the gods.&nbsp; One&rsquo;s in the hands of one&rsquo;s law&mdash;there
one is.&nbsp; As to the form the law will take, the way it will operate,
that&rsquo;s its own affair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Miss Bartram replied; &ldquo;of course one&rsquo;s
fate&rsquo;s coming, of course it <i>has</i> come in its own form and
its own way, all the while.&nbsp; Only, you know, the form and the way
in your case were to have been&mdash;well, something so exceptional
and, as one may say, so particularly <i>your</i> own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Something in this made him look at her with suspicion.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
say &lsquo;were to <i>have</i> been,&rsquo; as if in your heart you
had begun to doubt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she vaguely protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As if you believed,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;that nothing
will now take place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shook her head slowly but rather inscrutably.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
far from my thought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He continued to look at her.&nbsp; &ldquo;What then is the matter
with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said after another wait, &ldquo;the matter
with me is simply that I&rsquo;m more sure than ever my curiosity, as
you call it, will be but too well repaid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were frankly grave now; he had got up from his seat, had turned
once more about the little drawing-room to which, year after year, he
brought his inevitable topic; in which he had, as he might have said,
tasted their intimate community with every sauce, where every object
was as familiar to him as the things of his own house and the very carpets
were worn with his fitful walk very much as the desks in old counting-houses
are worn by the elbows of generations of clerks.&nbsp; The generations
of his nervous moods had been at work there, and the place was the written
history of his whole middle life.&nbsp; Under the impression of what
his friend had just said he knew himself, for some reason, more aware
of these things; which made him, after a moment, stop again before her.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Is it possibly that you&rsquo;ve grown afraid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Afraid?&rdquo;&nbsp; He thought, as she repeated the word,
that his question had made her, a little, change colour; so that, lest
he should have touched on a truth, he explained very kindly: &ldquo;You
remember that that was what you asked <i>me</i> long ago&mdash;that
first day at Weatherend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, and you told me you didn&rsquo;t know&mdash;that I
was to see for myself.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve said little about it since,
even in so long a time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Precisely,&rdquo; Marcher interposed&mdash;&ldquo;quite as
if it were too delicate a matter for us to make free with.&nbsp; Quite
as if we might find, on pressure, that I <i>am</i> afraid.&nbsp; For
then,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we shouldn&rsquo;t, should we? quite know
what to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had for the time no answer to this question.&nbsp; &ldquo;There
have been days when I thought you were.&nbsp; Only, of course,&rdquo;
she added, &ldquo;there have been days when we have thought almost anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything.&nbsp; Oh!&rdquo; Marcher softly groaned, as with
a gasp, half spent, at the face, more uncovered just then than it had
been for a long while, of the imagination always with them.&nbsp; It
had always had it&rsquo;s incalculable moments of glaring out, quite
as with the very eyes of the very Beast, and, used as he was to them,
they could still draw from him the tribute of a sigh that rose from
the depths of his being.&nbsp; All they had thought, first and last,
rolled over him; the past seemed to have been reduced to mere barren
speculation.&nbsp; This in fact was what the place had just struck him
as so full of&mdash;the simplification of everything but the state of
suspense.&nbsp; That remained only by seeming to hang in the void surrounding
it.&nbsp; Even his original fear, if fear it as had been, had lost itself
in the desert.&nbsp; &ldquo;I judge, however,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;that
you see I&rsquo;m not afraid now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I see, as I make it out, is that you&rsquo;ve achieved
something almost unprecedented in the way of getting used to danger.&nbsp;
Living with it so long and so closely you&rsquo;ve lost your sense of
it; you know it&rsquo;s there, but you&rsquo;re indifferent, and you
cease even, as of old, to have to whistle in the dark.&nbsp; Considering
what the danger is,&rdquo; May Bartram wound up, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m bound
to say I don&rsquo;t think your attitude could well be surpassed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John Marcher faintly smiled.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s heroic?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly&mdash;call it that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was what he would have liked indeed to call it.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
<i>am</i> then a man of courage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what you were to show me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He still, however, wondered.&nbsp; &ldquo;But doesn&rsquo;t the man
of courage know what he&rsquo;s afraid of&mdash;or not afraid of?&nbsp;
I don&rsquo;t know <i>that</i>, you see.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t focus it.&nbsp;
I can&rsquo;t name it.&nbsp; I only know I&rsquo;m exposed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but exposed&mdash;how shall I say?&mdash;so directly.&nbsp;
So intimately.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s surely enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enough to make you feel then&mdash;as what we may call the
end and the upshot of our watch&mdash;that I&rsquo;m not afraid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not afraid.&nbsp; But it isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;the end of our watch.&nbsp; That is it isn&rsquo;t
the end of yours.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve everything still to see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he asked.&nbsp; He had
had, all along, to-day, the sense of her keeping something back, and
he still had it.&nbsp; As this was his first impression of that it quite
made a date.&nbsp; The case was the more marked as she didn&rsquo;t
at first answer; which in turn made him go on.&nbsp; &ldquo;You know
something I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then his voice, for that of a
man of courage, trembled a little.&nbsp; &ldquo;You know what&rsquo;s
to happen.&rdquo;&nbsp; Her silence, with the face she showed, was almost
a confession&mdash;it made him sure.&nbsp; &ldquo;You know, and you&rsquo;re
afraid to tell me.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s so bad that you&rsquo;re afraid
I&rsquo;ll find out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All this might be true, for she did look as if, unexpectedly to her,
he had crossed some mystic line that she had secretly drawn round her.&nbsp;
Yet she might, after all, not have worried; and the real climax was
that he himself, at all events, needn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
never find out.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<p>It was all to have made, none the less, as I have said, a date; which
came out in the fact that again and again, even after long intervals,
other things that passed between them were in relation to this hour
but the character of recalls and results.&nbsp; Its immediate effect
had been indeed rather to lighten insistence&mdash;almost to provoke
a reaction; as if their topic had dropped by its own weight and as if
moreover, for that matter, Marcher had been visited by one of his occasional
warnings against egotism.&nbsp; He had kept up, he felt, and very decently
on the whole, his consciousness of the importance of not being selfish,
and it was true that he had never sinned in that direction without promptly
enough trying to press the scales the other way.&nbsp; He often repaired
his fault, the season permitting, by inviting his friend to accompany
him to the opera; and it not infrequently thus happened that, to show
he didn&rsquo;t wish her to have but one sort of food for her mind,
he was the cause of her appearing there with him a dozen nights in the
month.&nbsp; It even happened that, seeing her home at such times, he
occasionally went in with her to finish, as he called it, the evening,
and, the better to make his point, sat down to the frugal but always
careful little supper that awaited his pleasure.&nbsp; His point was
made, he thought, by his not eternally insisting with her on himself;
made for instance, at such hours, when it befell that, her piano at
hand and each of them familiar with it, they went over passages of the
opera together.&nbsp; It chanced to be on one of these occasions, however,
that he reminded her of her not having answered a certain question he
had put to her during the talk that had taken place between them on
her last birthday.&nbsp; &ldquo;What is it that saves <i>you</i>?&rdquo;&mdash;saved
her, he meant, from that appearance of variation from the usual human
type.&nbsp; If he had practically escaped remark, as she pretended,
by doing, in the most important particular, what most men do&mdash;find
the answer to life in patching up an alliance of a sort with a woman
no better than himself&mdash;how had she escaped it, and how could the
alliance, such as it was, since they must suppose it had been more or
less noticed, have failed to make her rather positively talked about?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never said,&rdquo; May Bartram replied, &ldquo;that it hadn&rsquo;t
made me a good deal talked about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah well then you&rsquo;re not &lsquo;saved.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It hasn&rsquo;t been a question for me.&nbsp; If you&rsquo;ve
had your woman I&rsquo;ve had,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;my man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you mean that makes you all right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oh it was always as if there were so much to say!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why it shouldn&rsquo;t make me&mdash;humanly,
which is what we&rsquo;re speaking of&mdash;as right as it makes you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; Marcher returned.&nbsp; &ldquo;&lsquo;Humanly,&rsquo;
no doubt, as showing that you&rsquo;re living for something.&nbsp; Not,
that is, just for me and my secret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>May Bartram smiled.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t pretend it exactly
shows that I&rsquo;m not living for you.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s my intimacy
with you that&rsquo;s in question.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed as he saw what she meant.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, but since,
as you say, I&rsquo;m only, so far as people make out, ordinary, you&rsquo;re&mdash;aren&rsquo;t
you? no more than ordinary either.&nbsp; You help me to pass for a man
like another.&nbsp; So if I <i>am</i>, as I understand you, you&rsquo;re
not compromised.&nbsp; Is that it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had another of her waits, but she spoke clearly enough.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s all that concerns me&mdash;to
help you to pass for a man like another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was careful to acknowledge the remark handsomely.&nbsp; &ldquo;How
kind, how beautiful, you are to me!&nbsp; How shall I ever repay you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had her last grave pause, as if there might be a choice of ways.&nbsp;
But she chose.&nbsp; &ldquo;By going on as you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was into this going on as he was that they relapsed, and really
for so long a time that the day inevitably came for a further sounding
of their depths.&nbsp; These depths, constantly bridged over by a structure
firm enough in spite of its lightness and of its occasional oscillation
in the somewhat vertiginous air, invited on occasion, in the interest
of their nerves, a dropping of the plummet and a measurement of the
abyss.&nbsp; A difference had been made moreover, once for all, by the
fact that she had all the while not appeared to feel the need of rebutting
his charge of an idea within her that she didn&rsquo;t dare to express&mdash;a
charge uttered just before one of the fullest of their later discussions
ended.&nbsp; It had come up for him then that she &ldquo;knew&rdquo;
something and that what she knew was bad&mdash;too bad to tell him.&nbsp;
When he had spoken of it as visibly so bad that she was afraid he might
find it out, her reply had left the matter too equivocal to be let alone
and yet, for Marcher&rsquo;s special sensibility, almost too formidable
again to touch.&nbsp; He circled about it at a distance that alternately
narrowed and widened and that still wasn&rsquo;t much affected by the
consciousness in him that there was nothing she could &ldquo;know,&rdquo;
after all, any better than he did.&nbsp; She had no source of knowledge
he hadn&rsquo;t equally&mdash;except of course that she might have finer
nerves.&nbsp; That was what women had where they were interested; they
made out things, where people were concerned, that the people often
couldn&rsquo;t have made out for themselves.&nbsp; Their nerves, their
sensibility, their imagination, were conductors and revealers, and the
beauty of May Bartram was in particular that she had given herself so
to his case.&nbsp; He felt in these days what, oddly enough, he had
never felt before, the growth of a dread of losing her by some catastrophe&mdash;some
catastrophe that yet wouldn&rsquo;t at all be the catastrophe: partly
because she had almost of a sudden begun to strike him as more useful
to him than ever yet, and partly by reason of an appearance of uncertainty
in her health, co-incident and equally new.&nbsp; It was characteristic
of the inner detachment he had hitherto so successfully cultivated and
to which our whole account of him is a reference, it was characteristic
that his complications, such as they were, had never yet seemed so as
at this crisis to thicken about him, even to the point of making him
ask himself if he were, by any chance, of a truth, within sight or sound,
within touch or reach, within the immediate jurisdiction, of the thing
that waited.</p>
<p>When the day came, as come it had to, that his friend confessed to
him her fear of a deep disorder in her blood, he felt somehow the shadow
of a change and the chill of a shock.&nbsp; He immediately began to
imagine aggravations and disasters, and above all to think of her peril
as the direct menace for himself of personal privation.&nbsp; This indeed
gave him one of those partial recoveries of equanimity that were agreeable
to him&mdash;it showed him that what was still first in his mind was
the loss she herself might suffer.&nbsp; &ldquo;What if she should have
to die before knowing, before seeing&mdash;?&rdquo;&nbsp; It would have
been brutal, in the early stages of her trouble, to put that question
to her; but it had immediately sounded for him to his own concern, and
the possibility was what most made him sorry for her.&nbsp; If she did
&ldquo;know,&rdquo; moreover, in the sense of her having had some&mdash;what
should he think?&mdash;mystical irresistible light, this would make
the matter not better, but worse, inasmuch as her original adoption
of his own curiosity had quite become the basis of her life.&nbsp; She
had been living to see what would <i>be</i> to be seen, and it would
quite lacerate her to have to give up before the accomplishment of the
vision.&nbsp; These reflexions, as I say, quickened his generosity;
yet, make them as he might, he saw himself, with the lapse of the period,
more and more disconcerted.&nbsp; It lapsed for him with a strange steady
sweep, and the oddest oddity was that it gave him, independently of
the threat of much inconvenience, almost the only positive surprise
his career, if career it could be called, had yet offered him.&nbsp;
She kept the house as she had never done; he had to go to her to see
her&mdash;she could meet him nowhere now, though there was scarce a
corner of their loved old London in which she hadn&rsquo;t in the past,
at one time or another, done so; and he found her always seated by her
fire in the deep old-fashioned chair she was less and less able to leave.&nbsp;
He had been struck one day, after an absence exceeding his usual measure,
with her suddenly looking much older to him than he had ever thought
of her being; then he recognised that the suddenness was all on his
side&mdash;he had just simply and suddenly noticed.&nbsp; She looked
older because inevitably, after so many years, she <i>was</i> old, or
almost; which was of course true in still greater measure of her companion.&nbsp;
If she was old, or almost, John Marcher assuredly was, and yet it was
her showing of the lesson, not his own, that brought the truth home
to him.&nbsp; His surprises began here; when once they had begun they
multiplied; they came rather with a rush: it was as if, in the oddest
way in the world, they had all been kept back, sown in a thick cluster,
for the late afternoon of life, the time at which for people in general
the unexpected has died out.</p>
<p>One of them was that he should have caught himself&mdash;for he <i>had</i>
so done&mdash;<i>really</i> wondering if the great accident would take
form now as nothing more than his being condemned to see this charming
woman, this admirable friend, pass away from him.&nbsp; He had never
so unreservedly qualified her as while confronted in thought with such
a possibility; in spite of which there was small doubt for him that
as an answer to his long riddle the mere effacement of even so fine
a feature of his situation would be an abject anticlimax.&nbsp; It would
represent, as connected with his past attitude, a drop of dignity under
the shadow of which his existence could only become the most grotesques
of failures.&nbsp; He had been far from holding it a failure&mdash;long
as he had waited for the appearance that was to make it a success.&nbsp;
He had waited for quite another thing, not for such a thing as that.&nbsp;
The breath of his good faith came short, however, as he recognised how
long he had waited, or how long at least his companion had.&nbsp; That
she, at all events, might be recorded as having waited in vain&mdash;this
affected him sharply, and all the more because of his at first having
done little more than amuse himself with the idea.&nbsp; It grew more
grave as the gravity of her condition grew, and the state of mind it
produced in him, which he himself ended by watching as if it had been
some definite disfigurement of his outer person, may pass for another
of his surprises.&nbsp; This conjoined itself still with another, the
really stupefying consciousness of a question that he would have allowed
to shape itself had he dared.&nbsp; What did everything mean&mdash;what,
that is, did <i>she</i> mean, she and her vain waiting and her probable
death and the soundless admonition of it all&mdash;unless that, at this
time of day, it was simply, it was overwhelmingly too late?&nbsp; He
had never at any stage of his queer consciousness admitted the whisper
of such a correction; he had never till within these last few months
been so false to his conviction as not to hold that what was to come
to him had time, whether <i>he</i> struck himself as having it or not.&nbsp;
That at last, at last, he certainly hadn&rsquo;t it, to speak of, or
had it but in the scantiest measure&mdash;such, soon enough, as things
went with him, became the inference with which his old obsession had
to reckon: and this it was not helped to do by the more and more confirmed
appearance that the great vagueness casting the long shadow in which
he had lived had, to attest itself, almost no margin left.&nbsp; Since
it was in Time that he was to have met his fate, so it was in Time that
his fate was to have acted; and as he waked up to the sense of no longer
being young, which was exactly the sense of being stale, just as that,
in turn, was the sense of being weak, he waked up to another matter
beside.&nbsp; It all hung together; they were subject, he and the great
vagueness, to an equal and indivisible law.&nbsp; When the possibilities
themselves had accordingly turned stale, when the secret of the gods
had grown faint, had perhaps even quite evaporated, that, and that only,
was failure.&nbsp; It wouldn&rsquo;t have been failure to be bankrupt,
dishonoured, pilloried, hanged; it was failure not to be anything.&nbsp;
And so, in the dark valley into which his path had taken its unlooked-for
twist, he wondered not a little as he groped.&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t
care what awful crash might overtake him, with what ignominy or what
monstrosity he might yet be associated&mdash;since he wasn&rsquo;t after
all too utterly old to suffer&mdash;if it would only be decently proportionate
to the posture he had kept, all his life, in the threatened presence
of it.&nbsp; He had but one desire left&mdash;that he shouldn&rsquo;t
have been &ldquo;sold.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<p>Then it was that, one afternoon, while the spring of the year was
young and new she met all in her own way his frankest betrayal of these
alarms.&nbsp; He had gone in late to see her, but evening hadn&rsquo;t
settled and she was presented to him in that long fresh light of waning
April days which affects us often with a sadness sharper than the greyest
hours of autumn.&nbsp; The week had been warm, the spring was supposed
to have begun early, and May Bartram sat, for the first time in the
year, without a fire; a fact that, to Marcher&rsquo;s sense, gave the
scene of which she formed part a smooth and ultimate look, an air of
knowing, in its immaculate order and cold meaningless cheer, that it
would never see a fire again.&nbsp; Her own aspect&mdash;he could scarce
have said why&mdash;intensified this note.&nbsp; Almost as white as
wax, with the marks and signs in her face as numerous and as fine as
if they had been etched by a needle, with soft white draperies relieved
by a faded green scarf on the delicate tone of which the years had further
refined, she was the picture of a serene and exquisite but impenetrable
sphinx, whose head, or indeed all whose person, might have been powdered
with silver.&nbsp; She was a sphinx, yet with her white petals and green
fronds she might have been a lily too&mdash;only an artificial lily,
wonderfully imitated and constantly kept, without dust or stain, though
not exempt from a slight droop and a complexity of faint creases, under
some clear glass bell.&nbsp; The perfection of household care, of high
polish and finish, always reigned in her rooms, but they now looked
most as if everything had been wound up, tucked in, put away, so that
she might sit with folded hands and with nothing more to do.&nbsp; She
was &ldquo;out of it,&rdquo; to Marcher&rsquo;s vision; her work was
over; she communicated with him as across some gulf or from some island
of rest that she had already reached, and it made him feel strangely
abandoned.&nbsp; Was it&mdash;or rather wasn&rsquo;t it&mdash;that if
for so long she had been watching with him the answer to their question
must have swum into her ken and taken on its name, so that her occupation
was verily gone?&nbsp; He had as much as charged her with this in saying
to her, many months before, that she even then knew something she was
keeping from him.&nbsp; It was a point he had never since ventured to
press, vaguely fearing as he did that it might become a difference,
perhaps a disagreement, between them.&nbsp; He had in this later time
turned nervous, which was what he in all the other years had never been;
and the oddity was that his nervousness should have waited till he had
begun to doubt, should have held off so long as he was sure.&nbsp; There
was something, it seemed to him, that the wrong word would bring down
on his head, something that would so at least ease off his tension.&nbsp;
But he wanted not to speak the wrong word; that would make everything
ugly.&nbsp; He wanted the knowledge he lacked to drop on him, if drop
it could, by its own august weight.&nbsp; If she was to forsake him
it was surely for her to take leave.&nbsp; This was why he didn&rsquo;t
directly ask her again what she knew; but it was also why, approaching
the matter from another side, he said to her in the course of his visit:
&ldquo;What do you regard as the very worst that at this time of day
<i>can</i> happen to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had asked her that in the past often enough; they had, with the
odd irregular rhythm of their intensities and avoidances, exchanged
ideas about it and then had seen the ideas washed away by cool intervals,
washed like figures traced in sea-sand.&nbsp; It had ever been the mark
of their talk that the oldest allusions in it required but a little
dismissal and reaction to come out again, sounding for the hour as new.&nbsp;
She could thus at present meet his enquiry quite freshly and patiently.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh yes, I&rsquo;ve repeatedly thought, only it always seemed
to me of old that I couldn&rsquo;t quite make up my mind.&nbsp; I thought
of dreadful things, between which it was difficult to choose; and so
must you have done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather!&nbsp; I feel now as if I had scarce done anything
else.&nbsp; I appear to myself to have spent my life in thinking of
nothing but dreadful things.&nbsp; A great many of them I&rsquo;ve at
different times named to you, but there were others I couldn&rsquo;t
name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were too, too dreadful?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too, too dreadful&mdash;some of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at him a minute, and there came to him as he met it, an
inconsequent sense that her eyes, when one got their full clearness,
were still as beautiful as they had been in youth, only beautiful with
a strange cold light&mdash;a light that somehow was a part of the effect,
if it wasn&rsquo;t rather a part of the cause, of the pale hard sweetness
of the season and the hour.&nbsp; &ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; she said at
last, &ldquo;there are horrors we&rsquo;ve mentioned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It deepened the strangeness to see her, as such a figure in such
a picture, talk of &ldquo;horrors,&rdquo; but she was to do in a few
minutes something stranger yet&mdash;though even of this he was to take
the full measure but afterwards&mdash;and the note of it already trembled.&nbsp;
It was, for the matter of that, one of the signs that her eyes were
having again the high flicker of their prime.&nbsp; He had to admit,
however, what she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh yes, there were times when we
did go far.&rdquo;&nbsp; He caught himself in the act of speaking as
if it all were over.&nbsp; Well, he wished it were; and the consummation
depended for him clearly more and more on his friend.</p>
<p>But she had now a soft smile.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh far&mdash;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was oddly ironic.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you mean you&rsquo;re prepared
to go further?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was frail and ancient and charming as she continued to look at
him, yet it was rather as if she had lost the thread.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do
you consider that we went far?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why I thought it the point you were just making&mdash;that
we <i>had</i> looked most things in the face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Including each other?&rdquo;&nbsp; She still smiled.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re quite right.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve had together
great imaginations, often great fears; but some of them have been unspoken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the worst&mdash;we haven&rsquo;t faced that.&nbsp; I
<i>could</i> face it, I believe, if I knew what you think it.&nbsp;
I feel,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;as if I had lost my power to conceive
such things.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he wondered if he looked as blank as he
sounded.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s spent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why do you assume,&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;that mine
isn&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because you&rsquo;ve given me signs to the contrary.&nbsp;
It isn&rsquo;t a question for you of conceiving, imagining, comparing.&nbsp;
It isn&rsquo;t a question now of choosing.&rdquo;&nbsp; At last he came
out with it.&nbsp; &ldquo;You know something I don&rsquo;t.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve
shown me that before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These last words had affected her, he made out in a moment, exceedingly,
and she spoke with firmness.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve shown you, my dear,
nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shook his head.&nbsp; &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t hide it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, oh!&rdquo; May Bartram sounded over what she couldn&rsquo;t
hide.&nbsp; It was almost a smothered groan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You admitted it months ago, when I spoke of it to you as of
something you were afraid I should find out.&nbsp; Your answer was that
I couldn&rsquo;t, that I wouldn&rsquo;t, and I don&rsquo;t pretend I
have.&nbsp; But you had something therefore in mind, and I see now how
it must have been, how it still is, the possibility that, of all possibilities,
has settled itself for you as the worst.&nbsp; This,&rdquo; he went
on, &ldquo;is why I appeal to you.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m only afraid of ignorance
to-day&mdash;I&rsquo;m not afraid of knowledge.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then
as for a while she said nothing: &ldquo;What makes me sure is that I
see in your face and feel here, in this air and amid these appearances,
that you&rsquo;re out of it.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve done.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve
had your experience.&nbsp; You leave me to my fate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, she listened, motionless and white in her chair, as on a decision
to be made, so that her manner was fairly an avowal, though still, with
a small fine inner stiffness, an imperfect surrender.&nbsp; &ldquo;It
<i>would</i> be the worst,&rdquo; she finally let herself say.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I mean the thing I&rsquo;ve never said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It hushed him a moment.&nbsp; &ldquo;More monstrous than all the
monstrosities we&rsquo;ve named?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More monstrous.&nbsp; Isn&rsquo;t that what you sufficiently
express,&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;in calling it the worst?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marcher thought.&nbsp; &ldquo;Assuredly&mdash;if you mean, as I do,
something that includes all the loss and all the shame that are thinkable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would if it <i>should</i> happen,&rdquo; said May Bartram.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What we&rsquo;re speaking of, remember, is only my idea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s your belief,&rdquo; Marcher returned.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
enough for me.&nbsp; I feel your beliefs are right.&nbsp; Therefore
if, having this one, you give me no more light on it, you abandon me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; she repeated.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m with you&mdash;don&rsquo;t
you see?&mdash;still.&rdquo;&nbsp; And as to make it more vivid to him
she rose from her chair&mdash;a movement she seldom risked in these
days&mdash;and showed herself, all draped and all soft, in her fairness
and slimness.&nbsp; &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t forsaken you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was really, in its effort against weakness, a generous assurance,
and had the success of the impulse not, happily, been great, it would
have touched him to pain more than to pleasure.&nbsp; But the cold charm
in her eyes had spread, as she hovered before him, to all the rest of
her person, so that it was for the minute almost a recovery of youth.&nbsp;
He couldn&rsquo;t pity her for that; he could only take her as she showed&mdash;as
capable even yet of helping him.&nbsp; It was as if, at the same time,
her light might at any instant go out; wherefore he must make the most
of it.&nbsp; There passed before him with intensity the three or four
things he wanted most to know; but the question that came of itself
to his lips really covered the others.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then tell me if
I shall consciously suffer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She promptly shook her head.&nbsp; &ldquo;Never!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It confirmed the authority he imputed to her, and it produced on
him an extraordinary effect.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s better
than that?&nbsp; Do you call that the worst?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think nothing is better?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>She seemed to mean something so special that he again sharply wondered,
though still with the dawn of a prospect of relief.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why
not, if one doesn&rsquo;t <i>know</i>?&rdquo;&nbsp; After which, as
their eyes, over his question, met in a silence, the dawn deepened,
and something to his purpose came prodigiously out of her very face.&nbsp;
His own, as he took it in, suddenly flushed to the forehead, and he
gasped with the force of a perception to which, on the instant, everything
fitted.&nbsp; The sound of his gasp filled the air; then he became articulate.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I see&mdash;if I don&rsquo;t suffer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In her own look, however, was doubt.&nbsp; &ldquo;You see what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why what you mean&mdash;what you&rsquo;ve always meant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She again shook her head.&nbsp; &ldquo;What I mean isn&rsquo;t what
I&rsquo;ve always meant.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s different.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s something new?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She hung back from it a little.&nbsp; &ldquo;Something new.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s not what you think.&nbsp; I see what you think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His divination drew breath then; only her correction might be wrong.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t that I <i>am</i> a blockhead?&rdquo; he asked
between faintness and grimness.&nbsp; &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t that it&rsquo;s
all a mistake?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A mistake?&rdquo; she pityingly echoed.&nbsp; <i>That</i>
possibility, for her, he saw, would be monstrous; and if she guaranteed
him the immunity from pain it would accordingly not be what she had
in mind.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; she declared; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
nothing of that sort.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve been right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet he couldn&rsquo;t help asking himself if she weren&rsquo;t, thus
pressed, speaking but to save him.&nbsp; It seemed to him he should
be most in a hole if his history should prove all a platitude.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Are you telling me the truth, so that I shan&rsquo;t have been
a bigger idiot than I can bear to know?&nbsp; I <i>haven&rsquo;t</i>
lived with a vain imagination, in the most besotted illusion?&nbsp;
I haven&rsquo;t waited but to see the door shut in my face?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shook her head again.&nbsp; &ldquo;However the case stands <i>that</i>
isn&rsquo;t the truth.&nbsp; Whatever the reality, it <i>is</i> a reality.&nbsp;
The door isn&rsquo;t shut.&nbsp; The door&rsquo;s open,&rdquo; said
May Bartram.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then something&rsquo;s to come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She waited once again, always with her cold sweet eyes on him.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s never too late.&rdquo;&nbsp; She had, with her gliding
step, diminished the distance between them, and she stood nearer to
him, close to him, a minute, as if still charged with the unspoken.&nbsp;
Her movement might have been for some finer emphasis of what she was
at once hesitating and deciding to say.&nbsp; He had been standing by
the chimney-piece, fireless and sparely adorned, a small perfect old
French clock and two morsels of rosy Dresden constituting all its furniture;
and her hand grasped the shelf while she kept him waiting, grasped it
a little as for support and encouragement.&nbsp; She only kept him waiting,
however; that is he only waited.&nbsp; It had become suddenly, from
her movement and attitude, beautiful and vivid to him that she had something
more to give him; her wasted face delicately shone with it&mdash;it
glittered almost as with the white lustre of silver in her expression.&nbsp;
She was right, incontestably, for what he saw in her face was the truth,
and strangely, without consequence, while their talk of it as dreadful
was still in the air, she appeared to present it as inordinately soft.&nbsp;
This, prompting bewilderment, made him but gape the more gratefully
for her revelation, so that they continued for some minutes silent,
her face shining at him, her contact imponderably pressing, and his
stare all kind but all expectant.&nbsp; The end, none the less, was
that what he had expected failed to come to him.&nbsp; Something else
took place instead, which seemed to consist at first in the mere closing
of her eyes.&nbsp; She gave way at the same instant to a slow fine shudder,
and though he remained staring&mdash;though he stared in fact but the
harder&mdash;turned off and regained her chair.&nbsp; It was the end
of what she had been intending, but it left him thinking only of that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you don&rsquo;t say&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had touched in her passage a bell near the chimney and had sunk
back strangely pale.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m too ill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too ill to tell me?&rdquo; it sprang up sharp to him, and
almost to his lips, the fear she might die without giving him light.&nbsp;
He checked himself in time from so expressing his question, but she
answered as if she had heard the words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know&mdash;now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Now&rsquo;&mdash;?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; She had spoken
as if some difference had been made within the moment.&nbsp; But her
maid, quickly obedient to her bell, was already with them.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
know nothing.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he was afterwards to say to himself that
he must have spoken with odious impatience, such an impatience as to
show that, supremely disconcerted, he washed his hands of the whole
question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said May Bartram.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you in pain?&rdquo; he asked as the woman went to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said May Bartram.</p>
<p>Her maid, who had put an arm round her as if to take her to her room,
fixed on him eyes that appealingly contradicted her; in spite of which,
however, he showed once more his mystification.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What then has happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was once more, with her companion&rsquo;s help, on her feet,
and, feeling withdrawal imposed on him, he had blankly found his hat
and gloves and had reached the door.&nbsp; Yet he waited for her answer.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What <i>was</i> to,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<p>He came back the next day, but she was then unable to see him, and
as it was literally the first time this had occurred in the long stretch
of their acquaintance he turned away, defeated and sore, almost angry&mdash;or
feeling at least that such a break in their custom was really the beginning
of the end&mdash;and wandered alone with his thoughts, especially with
the one he was least able to keep down.&nbsp; She was dying and he would
lose her; she was dying and his life would end.&nbsp; He stopped in
the Park, into which he had passed, and stared before him at his recurrent
doubt.&nbsp; Away from her the doubt pressed again; in her presence
he had believed her, but as he felt his forlornness he threw himself
into the explanation that, nearest at hand, had most of a miserable
warmth for him and least of a cold torment.&nbsp; She had deceived him
to save him&mdash;to put him off with something in which he should be
able to rest.&nbsp; What could the thing that was to happen to him be,
after all, but just this thing that had began to happen?&nbsp; Her dying,
her death, his consequent solitude&mdash;that was what he had figured
as the Beast in the Jungle, that was what had been in the lap of the
gods.&nbsp; He had had her word for it as he left her&mdash;what else
on earth could she have meant?&nbsp; It wasn&rsquo;t a thing of a monstrous
order; not a fate rare and distinguished; not a stroke of fortune that
overwhelmed and immortalised; it had only the stamp of the common doom.&nbsp;
But poor Marcher at this hour judged the common doom sufficient.&nbsp;
It would serve his turn, and even as the consummation of infinite waiting
he would bend his pride to accept it.&nbsp; He sat down on a bench in
the twilight.&nbsp; He hadn&rsquo;t been a fool.&nbsp; Something had
<i>been</i>, as she had said, to come.&nbsp; Before he rose indeed it
had quite struck him that the final fact really matched with the long
avenue through which he had had to reach it.&nbsp; As sharing his suspense
and as giving herself all, giving her life, to bring it to an end, she
had come with him every step of the way.&nbsp; He had lived by her aid,
and to leave her behind would be cruelly, damnably to miss her.&nbsp;
What could be more overwhelming than that?</p>
<p>Well, he was to know within the week, for though she kept him a while
at bay, left him restless and wretched during a series of days on each
of which he asked about her only again to have to turn away, she ended
his trial by receiving him where she had always received him.&nbsp;
Yet she had been brought out at some hazard into the presence of so
many of the things that were, consciously, vainly, half their past,
and there was scant service left in the gentleness of her mere desire,
all too visible, to check his obsession and wind up his long trouble.&nbsp;
That was clearly what she wanted; the one thing more for her own peace
while she could still put out her hand.&nbsp; He was so affected by
her state that, once seated by her chair, he was moved to let everything
go; it was she herself therefore who brought him back, took up again,
before she dismissed him, her last word of the other time.&nbsp; She
showed how she wished to leave their business in order.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
not sure you understood.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve nothing to wait for more.&nbsp;
It <i>has</i> come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oh how he looked at her!&nbsp; &ldquo;Really?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The thing that, as you said, <i>was</i> to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The thing that we began in our youth to watch for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Face to face with her once more he believed her; it was a claim to
which he had so abjectly little to oppose.&nbsp; &ldquo;You mean that
it has come as a positive definite occurrence, with a name and a date?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Positive.&nbsp; Definite.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know about the
&lsquo;name,&rsquo; but, oh with a date!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He found himself again too helplessly at sea.&nbsp; &ldquo;But come
in the night&mdash;come and passed me by?&rdquo;</p>
<p>May Bartram had her strange faint smile.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh no, it hasn&rsquo;t
passed you by!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if I haven&rsquo;t been aware of it and it hasn&rsquo;t
touched me&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah your not being aware of it&rdquo;&mdash;and she seemed
to hesitate an instant to deal with this&mdash;&ldquo;your not being
aware of it is the strangeness in the strangeness.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
the wonder <i>of</i> the wonder.&rdquo;&nbsp; She spoke as with the
softness almost of a sick child, yet now at last, at the end of all,
with the perfect straightness of a sibyl.&nbsp; She visibly knew that
she knew, and the effect on him was of something co-ordinate, in its
high character, with the law that had ruled him.&nbsp; It was the true
voice of the law; so on her lips would the law itself have sounded.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It <i>has</i> touched you,&rdquo; she went on.&nbsp; &ldquo;It
has done its office.&nbsp; It has made you all its own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So utterly without my knowing it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So utterly without your knowing it.&rdquo;&nbsp; His hand,
as he leaned to her, was on the arm of her chair, and, dimly smiling
always now, she placed her own on it.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s enough
if <i>I</i> know it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; he confusedly breathed, as she herself of late
so often had done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I long ago said is true.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll never know
now, and I think you ought to be content.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve <i>had</i>
it,&rdquo; said May Bartram.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But had what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why what was to have marked you out.&nbsp; The proof of your
law.&nbsp; It has acted.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m too glad,&rdquo; she then bravely
added, &ldquo;to have been able to see what it&rsquo;s <i>not</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He continued to attach his eyes to her, and with the sense that it
was all beyond him, and that <i>she</i> was too, he would still have
sharply challenged her hadn&rsquo;t he so felt it an abuse of her weakness
to do more than take devoutly what she gave him, take it hushed as to
a revelation.&nbsp; If he did speak, it was out of the foreknowledge
of his loneliness to come.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re glad of what
it&rsquo;s &lsquo;not&rsquo; it might then have been worse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned her eyes away, she looked straight before her; with which
after a moment: &ldquo;Well, you know our fears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He wondered.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s something then we never feared?&rdquo;</p>
<p>On this slowly she turned to him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Did we ever dream,
with all our dreams, that we should sit and talk of it thus?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He tried for a little to make out that they had; but it was as if
their dreams, numberless enough, were in solution in some thick cold
mist through which thought lost itself.&nbsp; &ldquo;It might have been
that we couldn&rsquo;t talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&rdquo;&mdash;she did her best for him&mdash;&ldquo;not
from this side.&nbsp; This, you see,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;is the
<i>other</i> side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; poor Marcher returned, &ldquo;that all sides
are the same to me.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then, however, as she gently shook
her head in correction: &ldquo;We mightn&rsquo;t, as it were, have got
across&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To where we are&mdash;no.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re <i>here</i>&rdquo;&mdash;she
made her weak emphasis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And much good does it do us!&rdquo; was her friend&rsquo;s
frank comment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does us the good it can.&nbsp; It does us the good that
<i>it</i> isn&rsquo;t here.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s past.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
behind,&rdquo; said May Bartram.&nbsp; &ldquo;Before&mdash;&rdquo; but
her voice dropped.</p>
<p>He had got up, not to tire her, but it was hard to combat his yearning.&nbsp;
She after all told him nothing but that his light had failed&mdash;which
he knew well enough without her.&nbsp; &ldquo;Before&mdash;?&rdquo;
he blankly echoed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before you see, it was always to <i>come</i>.&nbsp; That kept
it present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh I don&rsquo;t care what comes now!&nbsp; Besides,&rdquo;
Marcher added, &ldquo;it seems to me I liked it better present, as you
say, than I can like it absent with <i>your</i> absence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh mine!&rdquo;&mdash;and her pale hands made light of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With the absence of everything.&rdquo;&nbsp; He had a dreadful
sense of standing there before her for&mdash;so far as anything but
this proved, this bottomless drop was concerned&mdash;the last time
of their life.&nbsp; It rested on him with a weight he felt he could
scarce bear, and this weight it apparently was that still pressed out
what remained in him of speakable protest.&nbsp; &ldquo;I believe you;
but I can&rsquo;t begin to pretend I understand.&nbsp; <i>Nothing</i>,
for me, is past; nothing <i>will</i> pass till I pass myself, which
I pray my stars may be as soon as possible.&nbsp; Say, however,&rdquo;
he added, &ldquo;that I&rsquo;ve eaten my cake, as you contend, to the
last crumb&mdash;how can the thing I&rsquo;ve never felt at all be the
thing I was marked out to feel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She met him perhaps less directly, but she met him unperturbed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You take your &lsquo;feelings&rsquo; for granted.&nbsp; You were
to suffer your fate.&nbsp; That was not necessarily to know it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How in the world&mdash;when what is such knowledge but suffering?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked up at him a while in silence.&nbsp; &ldquo;No&mdash;you
don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suffer,&rdquo; said John Marcher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can I help at least <i>that</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Don&rsquo;t</i>!&rdquo; May Bartram repeated.</p>
<p>She spoke it in a tone so special, in spite of her weakness, that
he stared an instant&mdash;stared as if some light, hitherto hidden,
had shimmered across his vision.&nbsp; Darkness again closed over it,
but the gleam had already become for him an idea.&nbsp; &ldquo;Because
I haven&rsquo;t the right&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t <i>know</i>&mdash;when you needn&rsquo;t,&rdquo;
she mercifully urged.&nbsp; &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t&mdash;for we shouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t?&rdquo;&nbsp; If he could but know what she
meant!</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash; it&rsquo;s too much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too much?&rdquo; he still asked but with a mystification that
was the next moment of a sudden to give way.&nbsp; Her words, if they
meant something, affected him in this light&mdash;the light also of
her wasted face&mdash;as meaning <i>all</i>, and the sense of what knowledge
had been for herself came over him with a rush which broke through into
a question.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is it of that then you&rsquo;re dying?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She but watched him, gravely at first, as to see, with this, where
he was, and she might have seen something or feared something that moved
her sympathy.&nbsp; &ldquo;I would live for you still&mdash;if I could.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Her eyes closed for a little, as if, withdrawn into herself, she were
for a last time trying.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t!&rdquo; she said
as she raised them again to take leave of him.</p>
<p>She couldn&rsquo;t indeed, as but too promptly and sharply appeared,
and he had no vision of her after this that was anything but darkness
and doom.&nbsp; They had parted for ever in that strange talk; access
to her chamber of pain, rigidly guarded, was almost wholly forbidden
him; he was feeling now moreover, in the face of doctors, nurses, the
two or three relatives attracted doubtless by the presumption of what
she had to &ldquo;leave,&rdquo; how few were the rights, as they were
called in such cases, that he had to put forward, and how odd it might
even seem that their intimacy shouldn&rsquo;t have given him more of
them.&nbsp; The stupidest fourth cousin had more, even though she had
been nothing in such a person&rsquo;s life.&nbsp; She had been a feature
of features in <i>his</i>, for what else was it to have been so indispensable?&nbsp;
Strange beyond saying were the ways of existence, baffling for him the
anomaly of his lack, as he felt it to be, of producible claim.&nbsp;
A woman might have been, as it were, everything to him, and it might
yet present him, in no connexion that any one seemed held to recognise.&nbsp;
If this was the case in these closing weeks it was the case more sharply
on the occasion of the last offices rendered, in the great grey London
cemetery, to what had been mortal, to what had been precious, in his
friend.&nbsp; The concourse at her grave was not numerous, but he saw
himself treated as scarce more nearly concerned with it than if there
had been a thousand others.&nbsp; He was in short from this moment face
to face with the fact that he was to profit extraordinarily little by
the interest May Bartram had taken in him.&nbsp; He couldn&rsquo;t quite
have said what he expected, but he hadn&rsquo;t surely expected this
approach to a double privation.&nbsp; Not only had her interest failed
him, but he seemed to feel himself unattended&mdash;and for a reason
he couldn&rsquo;t seize&mdash;by the distinction, the dignity, the propriety,
if nothing else, of the man markedly bereaved.&nbsp; It was as if, in
the view of society he had not <i>been</i> markedly bereaved, as if
there still failed some sign or proof of it, and as if none the less
his character could never be affirmed nor the deficiency ever made up.&nbsp;
There were moments as the weeks went by when he would have liked, by
some almost aggressive act, to take his stand on the intimacy of his
loss, in order that it <i>might</i> be questioned and his retort, to
the relief of his spirit, so recorded; but the moments of an irritation
more helpless followed fast on these, the moments during which, turning
things over with a good conscience but with a bare horizon, he found
himself wondering if he oughtn&rsquo;t to have begun, so to speak, further
back.</p>
<p>He found himself wondering indeed at many things, and this last speculation
had others to keep it company.&nbsp; What could he have done, after
all, in her lifetime, without giving them both, as it were, away?&nbsp;
He couldn&rsquo;t have made known she was watching him, for that would
have published the superstition of the Beast.&nbsp; This was what closed
his mouth now&mdash;now that the Jungle had been thrashed to vacancy
and that the Beast had stolen away.&nbsp; It sounded too foolish and
too flat; the difference for him in this particular, the extinction
in his life of the element of suspense, was such as in fact to surprise
him.&nbsp; He could scarce have said what the effect resembled; the
abrupt cessation, the positive prohibition, of music perhaps, more than
anything else, in some place all adjusted and all accustomed to sonority
and to attention.&nbsp; If he could at any rate have conceived lifting
the veil from his image at some moment of the past (what had he done,
after all, if not lift it to <i>her</i>?) so to do this to-day, to talk
to people at large of the Jungle cleared and confide to them that he
now felt it as safe, would have been not only to see them listen as
to a goodwife&rsquo;s tale, but really to hear himself tell one.&nbsp;
What it presently came to in truth was that poor Marcher waded through
his beaten grass, where no life stirred, where no breath sounded, where
no evil eye seemed to gleam from a possible lair, very much as if vaguely
looking for the Beast, and still more as if acutely missing it.&nbsp;
He walked about in an existence that had grown strangely more spacious,
and, stopping fitfully in places where the undergrowth of life struck
him as closer, asked himself yearningly, wondered secretly and sorely,
if it would have lurked here or there.&nbsp; It would have at all events
sprung; what was at least complete was his belief in the truth itself
of the assurance given him.&nbsp; The change from his old sense to his
new was absolute and final: what was to happen had so absolutely and
finally happened that he was as little able to know a fear for his future
as to know a hope; so absent in short was any question of anything still
to come.&nbsp; He was to live entirely with the other question, that
of his unidentified past, that of his having to see his fortune impenetrably
muffled and masked.</p>
<p>The torment of this vision became then his occupation; he couldn&rsquo;t
perhaps have consented to live but for the possibility of guessing.&nbsp;
She had told him, his friend, not to guess; she had forbidden him, so
far as he might, to know, and she had even in a sort denied the power
in him to learn: which were so many things, precisely, to deprive him
of rest.&nbsp; It wasn&rsquo;t that he wanted, he argued for fairness,
that anything past and done should repeat itself; it was only that he
shouldn&rsquo;t, as an anticlimax, have been taken sleeping so sound
as not to be able to win back by an effort of thought the lost stuff
of consciousness.&nbsp; He declared to himself at moments that he would
either win it back or have done with consciousness for ever; he made
this idea his one motive in fine, made it so much his passion that none
other, to compare with it, seemed ever to have touched him.&nbsp; The
lost stuff of consciousness became thus for him as a strayed or stolen
child to an unappeasable father; he hunted it up and down very much
as if he were knocking at doors and enquiring of the police.&nbsp; This
was the spirit in which, inevitably, he set himself to travel; he started
on a journey that was to be as long as he could make it; it danced before
him that, as the other side of the globe couldn&rsquo;t possibly have
less to say to him, it might, by a possibility of suggestion, have more.&nbsp;
Before he quitted London, however, he made a pilgrimage to May Bartram&rsquo;s
grave, took his way to it through the endless avenues of the grim suburban
necropolis, sought it out in the wilderness of tombs, and, though he
had come but for the renewal of the act of farewell, found himself,
when he had at last stood by it, beguiled into long intensities.&nbsp;
He stood for an hour, powerless to turn away and yet powerless to penetrate
the darkness of death; fixing with his eyes her inscribed name and date,
beating his forehead against the fact of the secret they kept, drawing
his breath, while he waited, as if some sense would in pity of him rise
from the stones.&nbsp; He kneeled on the stones, however, in vain; they
kept what they concealed; and if the face of the tomb did become a face
for him it was because her two names became a pair of eyes that didn&rsquo;t
know him.&nbsp; He gave them a last long look, but no palest light broke.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<p>He stayed away, after this, for a year; he visited the depths of
Asia, spending himself on scenes of romantic interest, of superlative
sanctity; but what was present to him everywhere was that for a man
who had known what <i>he</i> had known the world was vulgar and vain.&nbsp;
The state of mind in which he had lived for so many years shone out
to him, in reflexion, as a light that coloured and refined, a light
beside which the glow of the East was garish cheap and thin.&nbsp; The
terrible truth was that he had lost&mdash;with everything else&mdash;a
distinction as well; the things he saw couldn&rsquo;t help being common
when he had become common to look at them.&nbsp; He was simply now one
of them himself&mdash;he was in the dust, without a peg for the sense
of difference; and there were hours when, before the temples of gods
and the sepulchres of kings, his spirit turned for nobleness of association
to the barely discriminated slab in the London suburb.&nbsp; That had
become for him, and more intensely with time and distance, his one witness
of a past glory.&nbsp; It was all that was left to him for proof or
pride, yet the past glories of Pharaohs were nothing to him as he thought
of it.&nbsp; Small wonder then that he came back to it on the morrow
of his return.&nbsp; He was drawn there this time as irresistibly as
the other, yet with a confidence, almost, that was doubtless the effect
of the many months that had elapsed.&nbsp; He had lived, in spite of
himself, into his change of feeling, and in wandering over the earth
had wandered, as might be said, from the circumference to the centre
of his desert.&nbsp; He had settled to his safety and accepted perforce
his extinction; figuring to himself, with some colour, in the likeness
of certain little old men he remembered to have seen, of whom, all meagre
and wizened as they might look, it was related that they had in their
time fought twenty duels or been loved by ten princesses.&nbsp; They
indeed had been wondrous for others while he was but wondrous for himself;
which, however, was exactly the cause of his haste to renew the wonder
by getting back, as he might put it, into his own presence.&nbsp; That
had quickened his steps and checked his delay.&nbsp; If his visit was
prompt it was because he had been separated so long from the part of
himself that alone he now valued.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s accordingly not false to say that he reached his goal
with a certain elation and stood there again with a certain assurance.&nbsp;
The creature beneath the sod knew of his rare experience, so that, strangely
now, the place had lost for him its mere blankness of expression.&nbsp;
It met him in mildness&mdash;not, as before, in mockery; it wore for
him the air of conscious greeting that we find, after absence, in things
that have closely belonged to us and which seem to confess of themselves
to the connexion.&nbsp; The plot of ground, the graven tablet, the tended
flowers affected him so as belonging to him that he resembled for the
hour a contented landlord reviewing a piece of property.&nbsp; Whatever
had happened&mdash;well, had happened.&nbsp; He had not come back this
time with the vanity of that question, his former worrying &ldquo;What,
<i>what</i>?&rdquo; now practically so spent.&nbsp; Yet he would none
the less never again so cut himself off from the spot; he would come
back to it every month, for if he did nothing else by its aid he at
least held up his head.&nbsp; It thus grew for him, in the oddest way,
a positive resource; he carried out his idea of periodical returns,
which took their place at last among the most inveterate of his habits.&nbsp;
What it all amounted to, oddly enough, was that in his finally so simplified
world this garden of death gave him the few square feet of earth on
which he could still most live.&nbsp; It was as if, being nothing anywhere
else for any one, nothing even for himself, he were just everything
here, and if not for a crowd of witnesses or indeed for any witness
but John Marcher, then by clear right of the register that he could
scan like an open page.&nbsp; The open page was the tomb of his friend,
and there were the facts of the past, there the truth of his life, there
the backward reaches in which he could lose himself.&nbsp; He did this
from time to time with such effect that he seemed to wander through
the old years with his hand in the arm of a companion who was, in the
most extraordinary manner, his other, his younger self; and to wander,
which was more extraordinary yet, round and round a third presence&mdash;not
wandering she, but stationary, still, whose eyes, turning with his revolution,
never ceased to follow him, and whose seat was his point, so to speak,
of orientation.&nbsp; Thus in short he settled to live&mdash;feeding
all on the sense that he once <i>had</i> lived, and dependent on it
not alone for a support but for an identity.</p>
<p>It sufficed him in its way for months and the year elapsed; it would
doubtless even have carried him further but for an accident, superficially
slight, which moved him, quite in another direction, with a force beyond
any of his impressions of Egypt or of India.&nbsp; It was a thing of
the merest chance&mdash;the turn, as he afterwards felt, of a hair,
though he was indeed to live to believe that if light hadn&rsquo;t come
to him in this particular fashion it would still have come in another.&nbsp;
He was to live to believe this, I say, though he was not to live, I
may not less definitely mention, to do much else.&nbsp; We allow him
at any rate the benefit of the conviction, struggling up for him at
the end, that, whatever might have happened or not happened, he would
have come round of himself to the light.&nbsp; The incident of an autumn
day had put the match to the train laid from of old by his misery.&nbsp;
With the light before him he knew that even of late his ache had only
been smothered.&nbsp; It was strangely drugged, but it throbbed; at
the touch it began to bleed.&nbsp; And the touch, in the event, was
the face of a fellow-mortal.&nbsp; This face, one grey afternoon when
the leaves were thick in the alleys, looked into Marcher&rsquo;s own,
at the cemetery, with an expression like the cut of a blade.&nbsp; He
felt it, that is, so deep down that he winced at the steady thrust.&nbsp;
The person who so mutely assaulted him was a figure he had noticed,
on reaching his own goal, absorbed by a grave a short distance away,
a grave apparently fresh, so that the emotion of the visitor would probably
match it for frankness.&nbsp; This fact alone forbade further attention,
though during the time he stayed he remained vaguely conscious of his
neighbour, a middle-aged man apparently, in mourning, whose bowed back,
among the clustered monuments and mortuary yews, was constantly presented.&nbsp;
Marcher&rsquo;s theory that these were elements in contact with which
he himself revived, had suffered, on this occasion, it may be granted,
a marked, an excessive check.&nbsp; The autumn day was dire for him
as none had recently been, and he rested with a heaviness he had not
yet known on the low stone table that bore May Bartram&rsquo;s name.&nbsp;
He rested without power to move, as if some spring in him, some spell
vouchsafed, had suddenly been broken for ever.&nbsp; If he could have
done that moment as he wanted he would simply have stretched himself
on the slab that was ready to take him, treating it as a place prepared
to receive his last sleep.&nbsp; What in all the wide world had he now
to keep awake for?&nbsp; He stared before him with the question, and
it was then that, as one of the cemetery walks passed near him, he caught
the shock of the face.</p>
<p>His neighbour at the other grave had withdrawn, as he himself, with
force enough in him, would have done by now, and was advancing along
the path on his way to one of the gates.&nbsp; This brought him close,
and his pace, was slow, so that&mdash;and all the more as there was
a kind of hunger in his look&mdash;the two men were for a minute directly
confronted.&nbsp; Marcher knew him at once for one of the deeply stricken&mdash;a
perception so sharp that nothing else in the picture comparatively lived,
neither his dress, his age, nor his presumable character and class;
nothing lived but the deep ravage of the features that he showed.&nbsp;
He <i>showed</i> them&mdash;that was the point; he was moved, as he
passed, by some impulse that was either a signal for sympathy or, more
possibly, a challenge to an opposed sorrow.&nbsp; He might already have
been aware of our friend, might at some previous hour have noticed in
him the smooth habit of the scene, with which the state of his own senses
so scantly consorted, and might thereby have been stirred as by an overt
discord.&nbsp; What Marcher was at all events conscious of was in the
first place that the image of scarred passion presented to him was conscious
too&mdash;of something that profaned the air; and in the second that,
roused, startled, shocked, he was yet the next moment looking after
it, as it went, with envy.&nbsp; The most extraordinary thing that had
happened to him&mdash;though he had given that name to other matters
as well&mdash;took place, after his immediate vague stare, as a consequence
of this impression.&nbsp; The stranger passed, but the raw glare of
his grief remained, making our friend wonder in pity what wrong, what
wound it expressed, what injury not to be healed.&nbsp; What had the
man <i>had</i>, to make him by the loss of it so bleed and yet live?</p>
<p>Something&mdash;and this reached him with a pang&mdash;that <i>he</i>,
John Marcher, hadn&rsquo;t; the proof of which was precisely John Marcher&rsquo;s
arid end.&nbsp; No passion had ever touched him, for this was what passion
meant; he had survived and maundered and pined, but where had been <i>his</i>
deep ravage?&nbsp; The extraordinary thing we speak of was the sudden
rush of the result of this question.&nbsp; The sight that had just met
his eyes named to him, as in letters of quick flame, something he had
utterly, insanely missed, and what he had missed made these things a
train of fire, made them mark themselves in an anguish of inward throbs.&nbsp;
He had seen <i>outside</i> of his life, not learned it within, the way
a woman was mourned when she had been loved for herself: such was the
force of his conviction of the meaning of the stranger&rsquo;s face,
which still flared for him as a smoky torch.&nbsp; It hadn&rsquo;t come
to him, the knowledge, on the wings of experience; it had brushed him,
jostled him, upset him, with the disrespect of chance, the insolence
of accident.&nbsp; Now that the illumination had begun, however, it
blazed to the zenith, and what he presently stood there gazing at was
the sounded void of his life.&nbsp; He gazed, he drew breath, in pain;
he turned in his dismay, and, turning, he had before him in sharper
incision than ever the open page of his story.&nbsp; The name on the
table smote him as the passage of his neighbour had done, and what it
said to him, full in the face, was that she was what he had missed.&nbsp;
This was the awful thought, the answer to all the past, the vision at
the dread clearness of which he turned as cold as the stone beneath
him.&nbsp; Everything fell together, confessed, explained, overwhelmed;
leaving him most of all stupefied at the blindness he had cherished.&nbsp;
The fate he had been marked for he had met with a vengeance&mdash;he
had emptied the cup to the lees; he had been the man of his time, <i>the</i>
man, to whom nothing on earth was to have happened.&nbsp; That was the
rare stroke&mdash;that was his visitation.&nbsp; So he saw it, as we
say, in pale horror, while the pieces fitted and fitted.&nbsp; So <i>she</i>
had seen it while he didn&rsquo;t, and so she served at this hour to
drive the truth home.&nbsp; It was the truth, vivid and monstrous, that
all the while he had waited the wait was itself his portion.&nbsp; This
the companion of his vigil had at a given moment made out, and she had
then offered him the chance to baffle his doom.&nbsp; One&rsquo;s doom,
however, was never baffled, and on the day she told him his own had
come down she had seen him but stupidly stare at the escape she offered
him.</p>
<p>The escape would have been to love her; then, <i>then</i> he would
have lived.&nbsp; <i>She</i> had lived&mdash;who could say now with
what passion?&mdash;since she had loved him for himself; whereas he
had never thought of her (ah how it hugely glared at him!) but in the
chill of his egotism and the light of her use.&nbsp; Her spoken words
came back to him&mdash;the chain stretched and stretched.&nbsp; The
Beast had lurked indeed, and the Beast, at its hour, had sprung; it
had sprung in that twilight of the cold April when, pale, ill, wasted,
but all beautiful, and perhaps even then recoverable, she had risen
from her chair to stand before him and let him imaginably guess.&nbsp;
It had sprung as he didn&rsquo;t guess; it had sprung as she hopelessly
turned from him, and the mark, by the time he left her, had fallen where
it <i>was</i> to fall.&nbsp; He had justified his fear and achieved
his fate; he had failed, with the last exactitude, of all he was to
fail of; and a moan now rose to his lips as he remembered she had prayed
he mightn&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; This horror of waking&mdash;<i>this</i>
was knowledge, knowledge under the breath of which the very tears in
his eyes seemed to freeze.&nbsp; Through them, none the less, he tried
to fix it and hold it; he kept it there before him so that he might
feel the pain.&nbsp; That at least, belated and bitter, had something
of the taste of life.&nbsp; But the bitterness suddenly sickened him,
and it was as if, horribly, he saw, in the truth, in the cruelty of
his image, what had been appointed and done.&nbsp; He saw the Jungle
of his life and saw the lurking Beast; then, while he looked, perceived
it, as by a stir of the air, rise, huge and hideous, for the leap that
was to settle him.&nbsp; His eyes darkened&mdash;it was close; and,
instinctively turning, in his hallucination, to avoid it, he flung himself,
face down, on the tomb.</p>

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit https://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
https://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

https://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
