        <h2> About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I'm a web developer with in-depth experience in UI/UX design. In a
              nutshell, I create websites that help organizations address business
              challenges and meet their needs. I manage everything from website
              navigation and layout to a company's web hosting and security
              architecture. My expertise lies within front-end web apps, and the
              main languages in my tech stack are JavaScript, Python, React, and of
              course HTML/CSS.
