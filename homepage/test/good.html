          I'm a web developer with in-depth experience in UI/UX design. In a
          nutshell, I create websites that help organizations address business
          challenges and meet their needs. I manage everything from website
          navigation and layout to a company's web hosting and security
          architecture. My expertise lies within front-end web apps, and the
          main languages in my tech stack are JavaScript, Python, React, and of
          course HTML/CSS.
